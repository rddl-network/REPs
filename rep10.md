## **Abstract**
This REP defines the process to onboard new types of hardware devices to the RDDL Network. 

## **Motivation**
 The goal of this REP is to enable 3rd parties to register new devices on the RDDL Network and let them participate in the Proof of Productivity. 
 
## **Specification**
The approval process verifies that a piece of hardware is really RDDL-compatible as defined in [REP-7](./rep7.md).
Please create PR to this file adding the official name of your hardware and some contact credentials so that we can reach out to you. The compatibility will be verified and the PR approved.
In case of a larger production, machineID issuance and registration capabilities will be assigned to you with a certain quota.
