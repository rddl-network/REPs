# RDDL Enhancement Proposals

This repository is the home of all RDDL Improvement Proposals (REPs), along with ideas for new ones and discussions around proposed or existing ones.
The process to add or change a REP is the following:

- The REP life-cycle SHOULD follow the life-cycle defined in [REP-2 (our variant of COSS)](./rep2.md).
- Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on [Raw](./rep2.md#raw-reps) and [Draft](./rep2.md#draft-reps) specifications.
