## **Abstract**
This REP defines the mechanisms that are utilized to let machines authenticate to RDDL infrastructure services.

## **Motivation**
 The goal of this REP is to describe the demand for RDDL infrastructure services and give the conceptual overview how machines are able to authenticate.


## **Problem Breakdown**


## **Specification**


## **Implementation**
The implementations must be completed before any REP is given status "stable", but it need not be completed before the REP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the REP and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## **Copyright Waiver**
Except for REP-1 (C4) and REP-2 (COSS), all REPs MUST be released to the public domain. To do that, the following block of HTML SHOULD be used in the REP's source Markdown file. ([HTML is valid Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html).)
