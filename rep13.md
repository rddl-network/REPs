## **Abstract**
[PoP](./rep11.md) expects direct interaction of the network with the participant. Delegated PoP enables offline participants to be represented by an actor that is able to participate in PoP successfully without owning the keys of the original actor. The new actor will be called delegated PoP participant.


## **Motivation**
The goal of this REP is to enable machines/participants to take part in PoP even though they might not be available on the network all the time.
